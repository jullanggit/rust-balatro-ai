Fetches joker & consumable info from fandom and generates the `JokerType`, `Tarot`, `Planet` and `Spectral` enum as well as their methods `name`, `buy_price` and `sell_price`, as well as `rarity`, `effect_type` and `compatibility` for jokers, from it. Also fetches assets.
Implemented as a separate crate instead of a proc macro to avoid having to have an internet connection when building and to avoid constantly regenerating the same info & assets.
